# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors given as a mini-project for my coding bootcamp in our week learning Javascript. The given User Story and Acceptance criteria are below.

## Files

The project consists of two main files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that displays the game interface in the browser.
- `script.js`: This JavaScript file contains the logic for the game. It handles player input, determines the computer's choice, compares the choices to determine the winner, and updates the game interface based on the results.

## How to Play

1. The game is deployed on [Github pages](https://roughnut.github.io/m03-mini-project-rock-paper-scissors/ "link to Rock, Paper, Scissors game")
2. You will be prompted to enter your name and make your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The computer's choice will be randomly selected.
4. The choices will be compared and the winner will be displayed on the screen.
5. You can play as many times as you like. The game keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and ties.
